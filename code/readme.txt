## To evaluate the classification of different grid GO to "2.Feature Extraction Codes" & RUN "GatherX"
## PowerTab AudioTab AllTab will be used to see classification efficiency due to our proposed feature.
## Detailed Describtion is provied in "GatherX"

1. ENF Extraction Codes : We used adi hajj code for ENF extraction
   source : Adi Hajj-Ahmad, R., MinWu,. Spectrum Combining for ENF Signal Estimation - Dataset & Codes,. 2013 [cited 2017 March 03]; Available from: http://cwwongpatch2.no-ip.org/mast_new/research.php?t=enf.

## following materials are extracted and evaluated in our work

2. Feature Extraction Codes: We used our method to get feature and used our proposed feature

3. Auxiliary Codes: We used this codes with in "Feature Extraction Codes"

4. "TabFeatAll13Grid" contains feature files "PowerTab AudioTab AllTab". We can see the effect of our feature as we add on our feature

5. "maxxfk.mat" contains our proposed feature set "Normalized Amplitude of the Harmonic components". We "maxxfk_plot" to see the values
   Our proposed another feature set "Polynomial model parameter" can be visualied using "pl_plot.m".
   "maxxfk_plot.m" & "pl_plot.m" are at "Auxiliary Codes" folder.

6. "max_min_ENF.mat" contains the range of ENF over different grids

7. "filter_8th.mat" contain filter parameters used in "GatherX".
